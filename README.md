# CuisineHub - Introduction

This is the first fullstack web application I'm building. It's a culinary website, where users can view other people's recipes, but also post their own.

## About this repository

This repository contains the files for the Frontend component of my application. The repository containing the backend files and the database .sql file can be found at: https://github.com/Wilson-Barbosa/recipes-app-BackEnd

The frontend portion is built with Angular version 16.2.0.

There is also a project to manage the different stages and features that will be implemented in the near future.

## Features to be added
